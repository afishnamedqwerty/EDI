# Celestial Orbital Forecasting with Sundial-Based Time Series Foundation Model

A Python implementation of a time series foundation model inspired by the Sundial paper, designed to predict orbital vector probabilities for celestial objects.

## Overview

This project leverages the Sundial architecture to forecast future positions and velocities of celestial objects based on their orbital calculations. The model is trained on precise orbital data extracted from the PDS Spice archives and aims to output probability distributions of possible future states while handling uncertainties inherent in space dynamics.

## Key Features

- **Sundial-Based Architecture**: Implements the core concepts from the Sundial paper for time series forecasting.
- **Probabilistic Predictions**: Generates distributions of possible future positions and velocities.
- **Handling Uncertainties**: Designed to account for orbital mechanics complexities and data noise.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle large-scale celestial datasets efficiently.

## File Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:
